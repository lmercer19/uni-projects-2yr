/**
 * This class is part of the "World of Home" application. 
 * "World of Home" is a very simple, text based travel game.  
 * 
 * This parser reads user input and tries to interpret it as a
 * command. Every time it is called it reads a line from the terminal and
 * tries to interpret the line as a two-word command. It returns the command
 * as an object of interface Command.
 *
 * The parser has a set of known command words. It checks user input against
 * the known commands, and if the input is not one of the known commands, it
 * returns a command that says that input command is unknown.
